Components in React:
-Components are the part of UI
-These are building clocks of Any React APP
-In React Template, the root component is names as 'APP'
-Components also support Nesting
-Components can be created with an extension of *.js or *.jsx

1.Functional Components

2.Class Components


Functional Components:(rfce)
-These are simple JavaScript Functions
-These can optionally receive an Object of Properties (props)
-These will return HTML as UI (JSX)
-Functional Components will accept props and returns JSX

Class Component:(rce)
-These are ES6/7 Classes
-Class components also recieve Optional Properties(Props) and Return JSX
-Apart from props, the class components will maintain a internal memory i,e State
-State is a private memory, which will be maintained for the component and used to describe in UI


If we use functional components, we can avoid 'this' keyword
functional components are simple where as class components are feature rich
Class components will use complex logics
class components will provide life cycle hooks


JSX:
-JSX stands for JavaScript XML
-It is an extension to JavaSCript Language syntax
-It looks like XML and Code for elements and components
-JSX tags have tag name,attributes and children similar to HTML and XML
-React apps can be constructed without JSX also
-JSX can be transpiles/converts to Pure JavaScript for browser understandabilty


Props:
-Props are the properties passing while rendering the components
-props are also immutable


State:
-State is a private memory which is immutable
-State is managed within the component
-State can be changed

Event Handling:
--------------


SetState:
-----------

De structuring Props & State:
-----------------------------
It is a unpacking of values from arrays or props
